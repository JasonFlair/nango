# Step 1: Setup the Nango CLI & nango-integrations folder

Install the Nango CLI globally: 
```bash
npm install -g nango
```

Your Nango _syncs_ live in your repo in a folder called `nango-integrations`. You can place this folder anywhere in your file tree, but we recommend you place it at the root level of your project.

In the folder where you want your integrations folder (e.g. root of your project), run:
```bash
nango init # Creates `./nango-integrations` with initial config
```

<Tip>
**Understanding the `nango-integrations` folder**

_Syncs_ have two parts:
- A global config file called `nango.yaml` with _sync_ names, frequency, models, etc.
- A small typescript file per _sync_, which defines the logic of the _sync_

They all live in a folder called `nango-integrations` in your own code repository.

```txt nango-integrations structure
<YOUR-REPO>
    |
    nango-integrations
            |
            +- nango.yaml
            +- github-issues.ts
            +- asana-tasks.ts
            ...
```

Our CLI helps you manage this directory, create scaffolds, validates the configuration, etc.
</Tip>

Next, we need to authenticate the CLI. Add the following env vars (e.g. in an `.env` file in `./nango-integrations`):
```bash
NANGO_SECRET_KEY_PROD='<prod-secret-key>'
NANGO_SECRET_KEY_DEV='<dev-secret-key>'
```

Get your `prod` and `dev` secret keys from the [Project Settings tab](https://app.nango.dev/project-settings) (toggle between the `prod` and `dev` environment in the left nav bar).

# Step 2: Create a _sync_

### Configure your _sync_ in `nango.yaml`

Open the `nango.yaml` file inside the `nango-integrations` folder and inspect its field:
```yaml nango.yaml
integrations:
	asana-dev: # Integration name (must match an integration name in the Integrations tab of your Nango dashboard).
		asana-tasks: # Arbitrary (unique) sync name
			runs: every 30min # Sync frequency
			return:
				- AsanaTask # Data model (defined below) as returned by your sync script

models: 
	AsanaTask: # Data model referenced above
		id: string # Required unique ID
        project_id: string
        name: string
        completed: boolean
        created_at: date
        modified_at: date
```

<Tip>
	Possible model types include `string`, `boolean`, `number`, `date`, `null` as well as arrays & nested objects. Union types can be used with `|`.

    A more complex example:
    ```yaml
    ExampleUser:
		id: string # Required, we recommend a string or number
        project_id: string
        names: string[] # An array of strings
        number_of_cats: number
        completed: boolean
        emails:
            personal_email: string
            business_email: string | null
            other_emails: string[] | null
        created_at: date # Date is a full timestamp with both date & time
        modified_at: date
    ```
</Tip>

Nango uses the models you define in `nango.yaml` to provide type safety when:
- you write _sync_ scripts
- _sync_ scripts run
- you fetch the synced data

_Syncs_ and data models can be combined at will:
- A _sync_ can return multiple data models: e.g. `AsanaTasks` and `AsanaComments`
- Multiple _syncs_ can return the same data model: e.g. Asana and Linear can both return a `Task`

This lets you easily **create your own unified API** with standard data models tailored to your needs.

### Write your _sync_

Modify the configuration of `nango.yaml` as you need and run (in `./nango-integrations`): 
```
nango generate
```

This will generate the scaffold for your _sync_ script(s). Open any _sync_ script (named `[sync-name].ts`) which contains the following template (for the Asana example above): 

```typescript asana-tasks.ts
import { NangoSync, AsanaTask } from './models';

export default async function fetchData(nango: NangoSync): Promise<{AsanaTask: AsanaTask[]}> {
	// Integration code goes here.
}
```
_Sync_ scripts mostly do 2 things. They: 
- incrementally fetch data from external APIs (with HTTP requests)
- transform the external data into the models that you defined in `nango.yaml`

This logic is defined by you so that you can build arbitrarily custom and complex integrations.

<Tip>
Your _sync_ scripts are deployed to Nango and automatically run on a schedule. Nango offers you multiple environments (dev & prod) to test & deploy your _syncs_.

Because your scripts run in Nango's cloud, you cannot import additional modules (external or relative) in the _sync_ scripts at the moment (we plan to resolve this limitation in the near future).
</Tip>

To develop syncs locally and test them run the following within `./nango-integrations`:
```bash
nango dev # Continuously watches integration files for changes.
```
Nango now watches your `nango-integrations` folder for changes and compiles the sync scripts & data models as needed. If there are any compilation errors (e.g. due to type issues) you can see them in the terminal where `nango dev` runs. 

Fill in the `fetchData` method with your integration code (in the example here, we fetch tasks from Asana):

```ts asana-taks.ts
import { NangoSync, AsanaTask } from './models';

export default async function fetchData(nango: NangoSync): Promise<{AsanaTask: AsanaTask[]}> {

    // Get the user's workspaces & projects
    // For testing we just get the first project of the first workspace
    const workspaces = await paginate(nango, '/api/1.0/workspaces');
    const workspace = workspaces[0];

    const projects = await paginate(nango, '/api/1.0/projects', { workspace: workspace.gid });
    const project = projects[0];

    // Get all tasks for the project
    const filters = {
        project: project.gid,
        opt_fields: 'name,completed,created_at,modified_at'
    }
    const tasks = await paginate(nango, '/api/1.0/tasks', filters);
    let mappedTasks: AsanaTask[] = [];

    for (let task of tasks) {

        mappedTasks.push({
            id: task.gid,
            project_id: project.gid,
            name: task.name,
            completed: task.completed,
            created_at: task.created_at,
            modified_at: task.modified_at
        });

        if (mappedTasks.length > 49) {
            await nango.batchSend(mappedTasks, 'AsanaTask');
            mappedTasks = [];
        }
    }

    return { AsanaTask: mappedTasks };
}

async function paginate(nango: NangoSync, endpoint: string, queryParams?: Record<string, string|string[]>) {
    const MAX_PAGE = 100;
    let results: any[] = [];
    let page = null;
    let callParams = queryParams || {};
    while (true) {

        if (page) {
            callParams['offset'] = `${page}`;
        }

        const resp = await nango.get({
            endpoint: endpoint,
            params: {
                limit: `${MAX_PAGE}`,
                ...callParams
            }
        });

        results = results.concat(resp.data.data);

        if (resp.data.next_page) {
            page = resp.data.next_page.offset;
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }

    return results;
}
```
_Sync_ scripts can return the created/update data to Nango in two different ways: 
- all at once, at the end of the script, with `return { ModelName: data };` (for small datasets)
- in batches, using `await nango.batchSend(data, 'ModelName');` (useful to break down large datasets)

<Tip>
To make API requests, use the proxy exposed by the `nango` object ([Proxy guide](/guides/proxy)).
    - `nango.get({})`
    - `nango.post({})`
    - etc

You do not need to specify the `providerConfigKey` and `connectionId` fields in the call to the Proxy. They are automatically injected.
</Tip>

<Tip>
The 1st run of the _sync_ is called "initial", meaning it fetches all the historical data (unless you have defined a backfill limit in the _sync_ script). On the 1st run, `nango.lastSyncDate` will be `null`.

Subsequent runs are called "incremental". They should only fetch the created & updated data. It's up to you to use the `nango.lastSyncDate` value to fetch the incremental changes.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Use `await nango.log()` to log data from within integration scripts.
</Tip>

### Dry run your _sync_

Before you deploy your _sync_ to your cloud account you can test it locally to make sure it works as expected. You will probably use this a lot whilst developing your sync.

Use the `dryrun` function of the CLI:

```bash
nango dryrun asana-tasks <connection-id>
```

Because this is a dry run, the fetched data will not be stored in Nango. Instead dryrun will print the data as returned.

<Tip>
By default, the Connection ID is fetched from your `Dev` environment. You can fetch _connections_ from your `Prod` environment with the `-e prod` flag.

To test incremental _sync_ runs, add the `-l` flag (which will populate the `nango.lastSyncDate` value in your script): 
```bash
nango dryrun asana-tasks <connection-id> -l "2023-06-20T10:00:00.000Z"
```
</Tip>

# Step 3: Deploy a _sync_

**1. Deploy to the `Dev` environment**
    
    When your _sync_ script is ready, youcan deploy it to your `Dev` environment in Nango:

    ```bash
    nango deploy dev
    ```

    Inspect the [Sync tab](https://app.nango.dev/syncs) to verify the deployment succeeded.

    <Tip>
        When you deploy your _sync_ Nango automatically adds it to all the existing _connections_ of the _integration_, and starts syncing their data.
        
        It will also add the _sync_ to any new _connection_ that is created (OAuth flow completes) for the _integration_.
        
        You can see all _syncs_ (and their status) for a _connection_ in the dashboard:

        ![View syncs in Dashboard](/images/connection-syncs.png)
    </Tip>

**2. Deploy to the `Prod` environment**
    
    Once you are ready to deploy to production, run:

    ```bash
    nango deploy prod
    ```

# Step 4: Retrieve the synced data

Fetch the always-fresh data from the _sync_ in your backend with the [backend SDK](/sdks) or the [REST API](/api-reference):

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Node SDK">

```ts
import { Nango }  from '@nangohq/node';

const nango = new Nango({ secretKey: '<your-dev-secret-key>' });

const result = await nango.getRecords({
    providerConfigKey: 'asana',
    connectionId: 'test-connection-id',
    model: 'AsanaTask'
});
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="cURL">

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.nango.dev/sync/records?model=AsanaTask \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <your-dev-secret-key>' \
  --header 'Connection-Id: test-connection-id' \
  --header 'Provider-Config-Key: asana'
```
</Tab>

</Tabs>

Nango can also send you [webhooks](/guides/webhooks) whenever new data is available from a _sync_.

That's it!

## Advanced Configuration

### Per customer/connections Field Mapping

Sometimes you need to have a field mapping that is specific to a customer. For instance, you want to let customers pick which field contains the email address of the contact.

You can store field mapping data that is specific to a _connection_ in Nango. The object must be JSON serializable, but there are no other constraints. 

For this, call:
    - `nango.setFieldMapping(...)` in the node SDK to store the field mapping
    - `nango.getFieldMapping()` in the _sync_ script to retrieve the field mapping of the current _connection_

In the future we want to help you more with field mappings (metadata requests to get available objects & fields, UI components etc.).
